## Task Details: Applying Design Patterns

The aim of this part is to demonstrate your understanding of design patterns to improve the architecture of Abominodo. You may either follow the suggestions below or use other patterns covered on the module or from the original Gamma et al. pattern catalogue.  You are to restructure an aspect of the code by using one design pattern. Additionally,  you need to produce a 3 page report that explains how 3 design patterns may be applied to this application. You may include source code snippets from your refactored Abominodo application and diagrams (e.g. UML class diagrams) to aid your explanation. Generic descriptions of patterns that do not relate to Abominodo will not attract any marks. 

### Suggestions for use of design patterns:

•	Using the MVC pattern to enable a fully interactive GUI. You should only concentrate on a simple GUI and on demonstrating the use of the pattern. This must incorporate the use of the Observer pattern.
•	Using the Strategy pattern to enable different algorithms to be used for game generation. 
•	Using the Command pattern to enable decisions to be undone.
